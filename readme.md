# Matador de Passarinho Key Logger

`Python 2.7`

I made this little project around 2015 to prank a colleague. I would hide the frozen version of the script in his computer and execute with another trigger, like on his IDE startup. Only works on Windows.

When someone types CTRL+C or CTRL+X the clipboard will be replaced with the string `Matador de Passarinho` and CTRL+V will not only paste `Matador de passarinho` but also play the `2081956.mp3` file and CTRL+Z will be disabled while the script is active.

Also `kl.py` stands for Key Logger which is pretty much what this script is.

## mp3play

This is a small utility to play mp3 files with windows.

## Rogério Skylab

My colleague wasn't a cultured man so he hated [Rogério's work](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Skylab), which is the inspiration for this script.
